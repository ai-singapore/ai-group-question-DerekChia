# Scenario: 
Anne’s parents are concerned. Anne, a primary school student, lost her right leg in a car accident last month. Since then, Anne has had problems adjusting. Walking with a prosthetic limb is awkward. Anne’s physiotherapist has been having problems convincing Anne to use her limb more often. Also, the accident was traumatic, and Anne’s school counsellor feels she needs help. Anne’s parents have full-time jobs and are not sure how to address Anne’s needs.

Can Artificial Intelligence help Anne?  

## Some ideas: 

* Chat interface 
* Sensor for physical symptoms 
* Image processing

## More considerations: 

* Who is our user? 
* Prosthetic limbs are very awkward, since every patient has individual patterns of movement. 
* Training time
* Interpretability
* Possible need to deploy a mobile or low-power solution
